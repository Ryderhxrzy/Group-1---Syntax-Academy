	<br><hr><br>

	<div class="lesson-content">
		<div class="lesson-card17"><h6>2D arrays are stored as arrays of arrays. Therefore, the way 2D arrays are declared is similar 1D array objects. 2D arrays are declared by defining a data type followed by two sets of square brackets.</h6></div>

		<p>How to Declare a Two Dimensional Array in Java</p>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card17"><h6>To create a two dimensional array in Java, you have to specify the data type of items to be stored in the array, followed by two square brackets and the name of the array.<br><br>Here's what the syntax looks like:<br>data_type[][] array_name;</h6></div>
		<br>

		<p>Let's look at a code example</p>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card17"><h6>int[][] oddNumbers = { {1, 3, 5, 7}, {9, 11, 13, 15} };<br>Don't worry if you're yet to understand what's going on above. In the next section, you'll learn more about how two dimensional arrays work and how to access items stored in them.</h6></div>
		<br>

		<p>How to Access Items in a Two Dimensional Array in Java</p>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card17"><h6>We can access items in a two dimensional using two square brackets.<br>The first denotes the array from which we want to access the items while the second denotes the index of the item we want to access.</h6></div>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card17"><h6>Let's simplify the explanation above with an example:<br>int[][] oddNumbers = { {1, 3, 5, 7}, {9, 11, 13, 15} };<br>System.out.println(oddNumbers[0][0]);<br>// 1</h6></div>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card26"><h6>In the example above, we have two arrays in the oddNumbers array – {1, 3, 5, 7} and {9, 11, 13, 15}.<br><br>The first array — {1, 3, 5, 7} — is denoted using 0.<br><br>The second array — {9, 11, 13, 15} — is denoted using 1.<br><br>First array is 0, second is 1, third is 2, and so on.<br><br>So to access an item from the first array, we assigned 0 to the first square bracket. Since we were trying to access the first item in the array, we used its index which is zero: oddNumbers[0][0].<br><br>Let's break it down even further.<br><br>Here's the code to access items: oddNumbers[?][?]<br><br>I've put question marks in both square brackets – we'll fill them in as we progress.<br><br>So let's say we want to access an item in the second array which is denoted using 1, our code will look like this: oddNumbers[1][?].<br><br>Now that we're in the second array ({9, 11, 13, 15}) let's try to access an item in it. Just like regular arrays, each items has an index starting from zero.<br><br>So to access 13 which is the third item, we pass its index number to the second square bracket: oddNumbers[1][2].</h6></div>
		<br>

		<p>How to Access Items in a Two Dimensional Array in Java Example</p>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card26"><h6>int[][] oddNumbers = { {1, 3, 5, 7}, {9, 11, 13, 15}, {17, 19, 21, 23} };<br>The objective here is to access 21 in the third array. Our access code still has question marks: oddNumbers[?][?].<br><br>We'll start by giving the first question mark a value which points to the particular array to access.<br><br>Array 0 => {1, 3, 5, 7}<br>Array 1 => {9, 11, 13, 15}<br>Array 2 => {17, 19, 21, 23}<br><br>The number we're looking for is in the third array with an array index of 2. So we've found the value for the first square bracket: oddNumbers[2][?]<br><br>The second square bracket's value will point to the actual item to be accessed. To do that, we have to specify the index number of the item. Here are the indexes in that array:<br><br>17 => Index 0<br>19 => Index 1<br>21 => Index 2<br>23 => Index 3<br>
		<br>21 has an index of 2 so we can go on and add that to the second square bracket: oddNumbers[2][2]. When you print that to the console, you'll get 21 printed out.<br><br>Here's what the code looks like:<br><br>int[][] oddNumbers = { {1, 3, 5, 7}, {9, 11, 13, 15}, {17, 19, 21, 23} };<br><br>System.out.println(oddNumbers[2][2]);<br>//21</h6></div>
		<br>

		<div class="lesson-card27"><h6>You can loop through all the items in a two dimensional array by using a nested loop. Here's an example:<br><br>int[][] oddNumbers = { {1, 3, 5, 7}, {9, 11, 13, 15}, {17, 19, 21, 23} };<br><br>for(int i = 0; i < oddNumbers.length; i++){<br>for(int j = 0; j < oddNumbers[i].length; j++){
		<br>System.out.println(oddNumbers[i][j]);<br>}<br>}<br><br>// 1<br>// 3<br>// 5<br>// 7<br>// 9<br>// 11<br>// 13<br>// 15<br>// 17<br>// 19<br>// 21<br>// 23<br>The code above prints out all the items in the oddNumbers array.</h6></div>
